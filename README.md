# Train-Station
A tool for producing .h5 and .keras AI models for image classification for up to 6 classes. Epochs and Batch Size are customizable. Each class must be in the form of a folder with images inside.


# Download Executable

# Usage
1. Download and run executable from Dropbox
2. Click "Add Samples" for each class, and select a folder with only images in it
3. Enter Epochs and Batch Size, and click "Train" **one time**
4. In the terminal that opened with the program, you can watch the training process
5. After the model has been trained, two file paths are shown in the terminal. These are the .h5 and .keras models

# Notes
1. This program will use all resources available to it while training, so manually limiting CPU usage of the prorgam may work best for you.
